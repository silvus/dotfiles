# Make Ctrl+Right stop at word ends instead of beginnings.
set afterends

# Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of tabs and/or spaces as the previous line (or as the next line if the previous line is the beginning of a paragraph).
set autoindent

# Save the last hundred search strings and replacement strings and executed commands, so they can be easily reused in later sessions.
set historylog

# Display line numbers to the left of the text area.
set linenumbers

# Enable mouse support, if available for your system. When enabled, mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a double click), and execute shortcuts. The mouse will work in the X Window System, and on the console when gpm is running. Text can still be selected through dragging by holding down the Shift key.
# set mouse

# Don't hard-wrap text at all. This option conflicts with fill -- the last one given takes effect.
set nowrap

# Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions. The cursor position is remembered for the 200 most-recently edited files.
set positionlog

# Make the Home key smarter. When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards). If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the line.
set smarthome

# Scroll the buffer contents per half-screen instead of per line.
set jumpyscrolling

# Remove trailing whitespace from wrapped lines when automatic hard-wrapping occurs or when text is justified. (The old form of this option, 'set justifytrim', is deprecated.)
set trimblanks

# Save a file by default in Unix format. This overrides nano's default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had. (This option has no effect when you also use set noconvert.)
set unix

# Suppress the title bar and instead show information about the current buffer at the bottom of the screen, in the space for the status bar. In this "mini bar" the filename is shown on the left, followed by an asterisk if the buffer has been modified. On the right are displayed the current line and column number, the code of the character under the cursor (in Unicode format: U+xxxx), the same flags as are shown by set stateflags, and a percentage that expresses how far the cursor is into the file (linewise). When a file is loaded or saved, and also when switching between buffers, the number of lines in the buffer is displayed after the filename. This number is cleared upon the next keystroke, or replaced with an [i/n] counter when multiple buffers are open. The line plus column numbers and the character code are displayed only when set constantshow is used, and can be toggled on and off with M-C. The state flags are displayed only when set stateflags is used.
set minibar
