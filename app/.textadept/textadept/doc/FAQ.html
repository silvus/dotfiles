<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
If Textadept is so minimalist, why are the downloads around 10MB in size and the
unzipped folders 10s of MBs in size?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
Each download contains 2 executables: a GUI version and a terminal version.
Furthermore, the Windows and OSX packages bundle in GTK+ runtimes, accounting
for some &frac34; of the total application size. (GTK+ is the cross-platform GUI
toolkit Textadept uses.) Then, starting in version 10, in order to be able to
run on older Linux systems whose libstdc++ does not support newer C++11 symbols,
the Linux executables statically link in a newer version of libstdc++. Finally,
nightly builds are compiled with debug symbols enabled in order to aid debugging
of various issues.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
On Linux I get a <code>error while loading shared libraries: &lt;lib&gt;: cannot open</code>
<code>shared object file: No such file or directory</code> when trying to run Textadept.
How do I fix it?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
It is difficult to provide a binary that runs on all Linux platforms since the
library versions installed vary widely from distribution to distribution. For
example, &ldquo;libpng14&rdquo; was available for many distributions starting in late 2009
while Ubuntu 12.04 (circa 2012) used &ldquo;libpng12&rdquo;. More recently, some
distributions have started using &ldquo;libncurses6&rdquo; while many distributions are
still on &ldquo;libncurses5&rdquo;. Unfortunately in these cases, the best idea is to
<a href="manual.html#Compiling">compile</a> Textadept. This process is actually very simple though. Only the
GTK+ development libraries are needed for the GUI version. (A development
library for a curses implementation is required for the terminal version.)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
On Windows my anti-virus software says Textadept contains a virus. Does it? Or
is this a false-positive?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
Textadept does not contain any viruses and it certainly is a false positive.
The likely culprit is the <code>textadept-curses.exe</code> executable, which runs in the
Windows command prompt.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
Why can&rsquo;t Textadept handle HUGE files very well?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
Textadept is an editor for programmers. It is unlikely a programmer would be
editing a gigantic log file. There are other tools for that case.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
When I open a file in a non-English language, I see a lot of strange characters.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
Textadept was not able to detect the file&rsquo;s encoding correctly. You&rsquo;ll need to
<a href="manual.html#Buffer.Encodings">help it</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
When I click the &ldquo;Compile&rdquo; or &ldquo;Run&rdquo; menu item (or execute the key command),
either nothing happens or the wrong command is executed. How can I tell
Textadept which command to run?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
The LuaDoc describes <a href="api.html#_M.Compile.and.Run">compile and run commands</a> and you can configure them in
your <a href="manual.html#Preferences">preferences</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
In the curses version on Linux, pressing <code>^Z</code> suspends Textadept instead of
performing an &ldquo;Undo&rdquo; action. How can I disable suspend and perform &ldquo;Undo&rdquo;
instead?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
Place the following in your <code>~/.textadept/init.lua</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>events.connect(events.SUSPEND, function()
  buffer:undo()
  return true
end, 1)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
In Linux, middle-clicking in the curses version does not paste the primary
selection and selecting text does copy to the primary selection. All other
terminal apps support this functionality, why not Textadept?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
It does; use the <code>Shift</code> modifier key with your middle-clicking and text
selecting. Textadept interprets non-<code>Shift</code>ed mouse events like a GUI
application.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
The curses version does not support feature <em>x</em> the GUI version does. Is this a
bug?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
Maybe. Some terminals do not recognize certain key commands like <code>Shift+Arrow</code>
for making selections. Linux&rsquo;s virtual terminals (the ones accessible with
<code>Ctrl+Alt+FunctionKey</code>) are an example. GNOME Terminal, LXTerminal and XTerm
seem to work fine. rxvt and rxvt-unicode do not work out of the box, but may be
configurable.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="manual.html#Curses.Compatibility">curses compatibility</a> section of the appendix. If the feature
in question is not listed there, it may be a bug. Please <a href="README.html#Contact">contact</a> me with any
bug reports.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
Pressing <code>^O</code> in the curses version on Mac OSX does not do anything. Why?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
For whatever reason, <code>^O</code> is discarded by the terminal driver. To enable it, run
<code>stty discard undef</code> first. You can put the command in your <em>~/.bashrc</em> or
<em>~/.bash_profile</em> to make it permanent.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
How can I get the terminal version on Mac OSX to show more than 8 colors?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
Enable the &ldquo;Use bright colors for bold text&rdquo; setting in your Terminal.app
preferences.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
Why does Textadept remember its window size but not its window position?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
Your window manager is to blame. Textadept is not responsible for, and should
never attempt to set its window position.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
I am not able to use the &ldquo;Consolas&rdquo; or [insert other Windows font package here]
on Windows. Textadept just uses a default font. How can I get it to use my font?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
You&rsquo;ll have to provide the full name of the font, such as &ldquo;Consolas Regular&rdquo;,
rather than just the name of the &ldquo;ttf&rdquo; file in your Fonts directory.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Q:</strong>
When I use Mercurial >= 3.9 to clone Textadept&rsquo;s source code repository, I get
an &ldquo;unsupported protocol&rdquo; error related to TLS. How do I get around this?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>
Set <code>hostsecurity.foicica.com:minimumprotocol=tls1.0</code> in your Mercurial
configuration, as stated by the error message. Then try cloning again.</p>
